## 1. Customization Options

   - Primary Color: Users can select a color that will be applied to the report's headings or other design elements. We can either select a color from the color palette or add the hex code of the color.

   - Primary Font: A dropdown allows users to select a font style (e.g., **Poppins**) that will be used in the report.

## 2. Logo Upload

    - Users can upload a custom logo that will appear in the exported report or PDF.
    - Clicking Upload allows users to select an image file.
    - After a logo is uploaded, it is displayed under **Uploaded Logo**, with a link to the file which we can download it as well.

## 3. Available Variables

- This section serves as a reference purpose for users to be used as variables. These variables can be used in **Content** section of the template. For eg: Placeholders like **&#123;&#123;.name&#125;&#125;, &#123;&#123;.email&#125;&#125;** and many more as shown above are replaced with actual values when the PDF is being generated. 

## 4. Content section

![Content section](/images/guides/application-report-export/content.png)

- Users can insert dynamic placeholders (e.g., **&#123;&#123;.grantName&#125;&#125;**) that will be replaced with actual application details when generating the report or PDF.
