## How Post-success Report works?

### 1. Add Post-Success Report

- An **Add post-success report** button is provided to create a new report.

- When the user clicks the **Add post-success report** button, a modal appears titled **Create Post Success Report Form**. This modal contains fields for:
    - **Name**
    - **Send On**
    - **Schedule**
    - **Ending On**

- After adding the end date, it automatically generates a timeline for the Post-Success Report. This timeline lists the scheduled reports based on the selected Send On date, Schedule interval, and Ending On date.
    - For example: 
        - If the report is scheduled Every Week and starts on March 21, 2025, with an end date of March 28, 2025, the system generates two reports.
        - And if the report is scheduled one off then the timeline is not displayed. Since a one-off report is sent only once on the selected Send On date, there is no recurring schedule.

- After filling in the required fields and clicking Next, users are directed to the Templates selection screen. Here they can: 
    - **Choose an existing template**: Select a predefined template to use for the Progress Report form.
    - **Create a new template**: Click on **Create new template** to make a custom template according to the requirements.
    - **Start from scratch**
