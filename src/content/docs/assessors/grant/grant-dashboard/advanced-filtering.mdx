This feature allows users to search and filter applications based on various conditions. The **Filter** button enables the advanced filtering options, making it easier to refine the displayed data.

## How Advanced Filtering works

### 1. Click on the Filter button
    - When the **Filter** button is clicked, the advanced filtering section appears just below the **Filter** button.
    - Allows users to define specific conditions for filtering applications.

### 2. Content or Title
    - A dropdown menu is provided which allows users to select the field to filter by.
    - The filtering options include fields from the Applications table headers as well as Form fields, allowing users to refine their search based on specific criteria.

### 3. Operator Dropdown
    - Defines a comparision rule for the selected field.
    - The **operator** dropdown dynamically adjusts based on the selected **Content or Title** field. For eg:
        - If the selected field is a text-based field (e.g., applicant name, status), operators like **Is Equal To** and **Is Not Equal To** are available.
        - If the field contains numerical values (e.g., rank or scores), operators such as **Is Equal To**, **Is Greater Than**, **Less Than** etc are provided.
    - So, this depends on the selected **Content or Title** field.

### 4. Value
    - The value field allows users to input a specific value to be searched for.
    - When the Content provided is **Email**, Operator is **Matches a Pattern** and Value is **sameer**, the result is shown as below.

### 5. Add Filter
    - By adding another filter, this allows compound filtering where multiple conditions can be combined using either:
        - **AND:** The results must satisfy all applied filters.
        - **OR:** The results will include entries that match at least one of the filters.

### 6. Applying and Saving Filter
    - Once a filter is applied, we can **Save** it for later use as well.

        **Saving Options:**
            - Save for Myself : The filter will be available only to the user who created it.
            - Save for Organization : The filter will be accessible to all users within the organization.

 ### 7. Filter Naming Modal 
    - Upon selecting a save option, a modal appears prompting the user to enter a name for the filter. This ensures easy identification and retrieval of saved filters later.

 ### 8. Quick Filter
    - After saving a filter with a specific name, it appears as a **Quick Filter** at the top of the application list. Upon clicking would filter the applications list based on the selected filter.
