The Reports section provides an overview os **Application Statuses or Stages**, **Budget Distribbution**, **Assessment Results** as well as **Dynamic Reports**. By default, the Reports section displays applications across all stages for all grants. We can filter by a specific grant using the **Filter grants..** dropdown at the top right.

## Status Panel
This Status table displays different stages of applications along with the corresponding count of applications in each stage.


## Budget Panel
    - Provides a visual breakdown of grant spending in the form of a donut chart. 
    - Allows to view financial data across different years. We can select a **Last Year** dropdown that enables users to change the time frame for the budget report. When a user selects a timeframe, the budget visualization (donut chart) updates accordingly, helping to track spending patterns and financial performance across different periods. 
    - It categorizes financial data into three key segments:

        - **Spent :** Funds that have already been used.
        - **Committed :** Funds that have been allocated but not yet spent.
        - **Remaining :** Budget that has not been allocated or spent.
