The Forms Page allows us to input data into the form elements which were previously added using the Form Builder.This page enforces the validation rules set in the Form Builder.

The key features of this page include:

- **Predefined Structure**: Displays fields as configured in the builder.
- **Validation**: Validation rules are defined in the Form Builder and enforced on the Forms Page. Examples include:
    - **Required Fields**: If a field is marked as required, the form cannot be submitted without it.

    - **Numeric Validation**: Numeric fields must meet set constraints (e.g., “Value must be greater than 100”).
    - **File Validation**: 
        - Users can specify the types of files that can be uploaded. The file maybe of All Types, or of specific type (e.g., **img, pdf, videos, docs** etc.) 
        - The system enforces limits on the number of files that can be uploaded at once. The form builder allows configuration such as:
            - **Single File Upload**: Only one file can be uploaded.
            - **Multiple Files Upload**: Allows multiple files, with a maximum limit (e.g., 5, 10, etc.).
        - **File SIze Limit**: Users can define maximum file size constraints for uploads to prevent excessively large files. The available file sizes are **5MB, 10MB, 50MB, 100MB**. 
        
    - **Character Limits**: A Rich Text Field may allow up to 750 words.
    
- The Forms Page will prevent submission if any validation rule is not met, displaying appropriate error messages to guide the user.
