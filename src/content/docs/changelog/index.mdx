# March 2025 - 🚀 Dynamic Reports, Smart Filters, Granular Permissions & We’re Now SOC 2 Certified!

We’re thrilled to share some major updates that reinforce our commitment to security, efficiency, and a smoother user experience.

## 🔐 SOC 2 Type 2 Certification
Optible is now SOC 2 Type 2 Certified—a significant milestone in our dedication to security, reliability, and privacy.
What is SOC 2 Type 2?
SOC 2 is a globally recognised standard for managing customer data. Achieving Type 2 certification means we’ve passed an independent audit of our systems and processes over an extended period, not just at a single moment.

## What This Means for You:
- 🔒 Your data is protected with audited security controls
- 🕒 Our systems are reliable, monitored, and resilient
- 🛡️ Internal processes—from access controls to backups—meet enterprise-grade standards

You can trust that your information is safe and your experience remains stable.
