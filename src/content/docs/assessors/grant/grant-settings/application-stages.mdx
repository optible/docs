The **Application Stages** page provides an organized view of different stages in an application's lifecycle. Each stage consists of multiple statuses that represent the progress of an application. Users can manage these statuses by adding, editing, or deleting them.

The Application stages is divided into 4 different stages, which are:
- **New Submission**
- **Processing**
- **Outcomes**
- **Archived**

## 1. Application Status Table
Each stage has a table with the following columns:
    - **Status**: The name of the status (e.g., Awaiting Review, Panel Discussion).
    - **Description**: A brief explanation of the status (optional).
    - **Action**:
            - **Edit**: Allows users to modify an existing status.
            - **Delete**: Removes the status from the stage.

## 2. Add Status
- We can add a new status by clicking on the **Add New Status** button which is located at the bottom of the table.
- The **Add New Status** page allows users to define a new status within a specific application stage.
- The page provides fields to be filled to add a new status. The fields are as follows:

    - **Status**: A text input field where users enter the name of the new status (e.g. Awaiting Approval).

    - **Description**: A text field for providing additional details or explanations about the status. This helps users understand when and why this status should be applied. This field is optional.

    - **Stage**: Displays the application stage to which this status belongs (e.g. New Submission).This field is pre-filled based on where the user initiated the "Add Status" action.

    - **Hide Optible Score**: This is a toggle switch, when enabled allows users to hide the **Optible Score** for application in this status. The scores are shown in the **Criteria Score** section in the **Application Detail Page** of the application.

    - **Hide Peer Score**: This is a toggle switch, when enabled allows users to hide the **Peer Score** for application in this status. The scores are shown in the **Criteria Score** section in the **Application Detail Page** of the application.

After filling in all the required fields and finalizing the status, users can save the status. Once saved, the status will be added to the Application Status Table, where it can be viewed, edited, or deleted as needed.
