# November 2024
## üöÄ **Major Updates**
- **SOC 2 Type 1 Certification**
  - Optible is now officially SOC 2 Type 1 Certified, demonstrating our commitment to the highest standards of data security and operational excellence.

2. **Improved Application Sorting**

## ‚ú® **Applicant Experience Improvements**
1. **New Applicant Onboarding**
   - A new **start page** prompts applicants to create an account before starting an application, making it easier to manage draft applications.

2. **Draft Application Alerts**
   - Applicants trying to start a new application with the same email will now be notified of an existing draft and prompted to resume it, reducing the chances of losing draft applications.

## üìä **Progress Report**
