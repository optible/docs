The Reports section provides an overview of **Application Statuses or Stages**, **Budget Distribution**, **Assessment Results** as well as **Dynamic Reports**. By default, this section displays reports for all grants. We can filter by a specific grant using the **Filter grants..** dropdown at the top right.

## Budget Panel
    - Provides a visual breakdown of grant spending in the form of a donut chart. 
    - Categorizes financial data into three key segments:
        - **Spent :** Funds that have already been used.
        - **Committed :** Funds that have been allocated but not yet spent.
        - **Remaining :** Budget that has not been allocated or spent.
    - Allows to view financial data across different years. We can select a **Last Year** dropdown that enables users to change the time frame for the budget report. When a user selects a timeframe, the budget visualization (donut chart) updates accordingly, helping to track spending patterns and financial performance across different periods.

## Assessment Results Panel

- This section presents a visual summary of assessment results helping users quickly understand the approval and rejection rates of applications.

- As by default, this shows the accepted and rejection rates of all applications of grants within an organization. And after filtering would show the accepted and rejection rates of applications of a specific grant.

- Gives insights into why applications are being rejected.

## Dynamic Report 

This is a dynamic report that allows to view reports based on selected data preferences. The report is customizable and in the below case, the report is showing applications **id** and **name**.

There is an icon on the right side where users can use it to export the displayed report as a CSV file.
