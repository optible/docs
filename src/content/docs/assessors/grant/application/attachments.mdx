This section allows you to upload and view the files associated with an application. Below is the breakdown:

## 1. Viewing attachments

    - We can see a structured list of uploaded files. 
    - The files are grouped under categories or labels (folders). 
    - Each file entry shows the filename, uploaded date, and actions (delete or download).

## 2. Upload Attachments

    - The upload icon as shown, when clicked opens a modal as shown above from where we can upload files.
    - It contains a **Placeholder label** and a **File Upload** section. 
    - The **Placeholder label** is optional but when it is provided, it acts as a folder or category for the files uploaded below it. It helps in organizing files into meaningful sections rather than having a flat list.

## Viewing Uploaded Files
    - Allows users to preview the uploaded content directly without downloading it.
    - Clicking on the file name opens a modal with the uploaded content which we can download it as well by clicking on the Download Attachment button.
